# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
This project involved credit card fraud detection using variational autoencoders (VAEs). I used a dataset of credit card transactions, which was highly imbalanced. I trained a VAE model to generate synthetic samples from the minority class and augment the training data. I then trained a logistic regression classifier and evaluated it on test set.
